Tracker Code Review Chrome extension
====================================

Take a commit from a github page and generate a pivotal tracker story


## Installing

1. clone the repo
2. go to chrome://extensions/
3. click the "Developer mode" checkbox
4. click "Load unpacked extensionâ€¦" and select the cloned repo
5. click on the options link (next to the allow in incognito checkbox and the reload link)
6. paste in your Tracker api key and click "Save Settings"

## Usage

The extension puts an icon next to the location bar (the generic puzzle piece). 
Click this when viewing a github commit page and it will try to grab the commit information 
and put it in a form which can be submitted to create a new tracker story. **Make sure to choose a project**
